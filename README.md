# SchemToSchematic
Convert the new 1.13+ .schem files to the legacy .schematic files

Use Original made by [puregero](https://github.com/puregero) [here](https://puregero.github.io/SchemToSchematic/)

Changes:
 - Banners are now correctly converted to .schematic (only for Minecraft Bedrock)
 
 PS: I'll only focus on Bedrock Edition support. Sry Java players, you should take a look to at the [original project](https//github.com/PureGero/SchemToSchematic)
